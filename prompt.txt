Task
-----
Look at a short sequence of images from a fixed security camera and decide whether it contains any **unusual or suspicious activity**.
You will receive a TIME-ORDERED SEQUENCE of images from a fixed security camera. Compare the frames to find motion or changes.

Ignore static background elements (do NOT mention them):
- Signs or text of any kind (“Residents & Guests”, “Tow‑Away Zone”, arrows, etc.)
- Bollards, fences, poles, buildings, parked cars, road markings, trees, lighting poles, etc.

Focus ONLY on **dynamic elements** that MOVE during the clip (people, vehicles in motion, objects being moved).

Consistency & Self‑check
------------------------
Before you output the JSON:
1. Draft your decision (`suspicious`) and a description of up to four sentences.
2. If your description says the activity is **normal** or **not unusual**, ensure `suspicious` = "No".
3. If `suspicious` = "Yes", ensure your description clearly states **what** makes it unusual or suspicious (e.g., trespassing, loitering, climbing fence, carrying weapon, wearing disguise at night, etc.).
4. If there is a mismatch, revise either the flag or the description so they **agree**.
5. Confirm you used **all** frames, not just the first.

Output
------
Return **only** the JSON below (no extra text or markdown):

{
  "suspicious": "Yes" | "No",
  "description": "Up to FOUR sentences describing only moving elements and why the scene IS or IS NOT suspicious. Make sure this description aligns with the suspicious flag."
}
